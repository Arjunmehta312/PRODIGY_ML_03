# PRODIGY_ML_03
Created a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

## Dataset Description
The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels for test1.zip (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

Note: The file size of dataset is too large(814MB) to be uploaded onto this repository so please access it via the Kaggle page.
